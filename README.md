# Hey, my name is Nicolas Vicente :)
I am about to start my senior year at California State University, San Bernardino in Fall 2025. 
I am pursuing a bachelors in Information Systems and Technology with a Cybersecurity concentration. 

In addtion to obtaining a formal education, I have also:
- Competed in the National Cyber League competitions (2021-2023)
- Competed in the Department of Energy's Cyberforce competition (November 2024)

Some of the platforms I have used to supplement my knowledge include:
- TryHackMe
- KC7Cyber

I have recently built a website to host my blog posts and résumé if you would like to check it out [here](https://nicolas-vicente.github.io/).
This website shows more of my background and gives you a little more insight into me outside of cybersecurity. 

## I am using GitHub to host my projects
Feel free to check out my repositories and see what I have been up to.
At the time of this writing, I am working on a [ticketing system](https://github.com/nicolas-vicente/ticketing-system) that I will be using in my self-hosted environment.

## Connect with me :)
If you would like to connect with me on LinkedIn here is a [link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-v-b5658b227/) to my profile. 
I am open to collaborating and making network connections, but no pressure.
